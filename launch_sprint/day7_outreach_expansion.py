Hi {{first_name}},

I hope this email finds you well. I'm Oliver Paynter, founder of OrPaynter, and I'm reaching out because I believe we can help {{company}} dramatically improve claims processing efficiency while reducing fraud.

**The Challenge:**
Insurance companies lose $7B annually to roofing fraud, while legitimate claims take 45+ days to process, frustrating both customers and adjusters.

**Our Solution:**
OrPaynter's AI platform processes roofing claims in under 60 seconds with:
- 97% damage detection accuracy
- 94% fraud detection rate
- 50% reduction in processing time
- $2M+ annual savings for mid-size insurers

**Why This Matters for {{company}}:**
{{specific_company_pain_point}}

**Proof Points:**
- Currently piloting with State Farm (45 claims processed)
- 250+ beta users with 4.8/5 satisfaction
- $2.3M in damage accurately detected and documented

**Next Step:**
I'd love to show you a 15-minute demo of how we're revolutionizing claims processing. Are you available for a brief call next week?

I can also connect you with {{mutual_connection}} who recommended I reach out.

Hi {{first_name}},

As a fellow roofing professional (I've been in the business for 15+ years), I know how time-consuming and inconsistent manual roof inspections can be.

That's why I built OrPaynter - AI technology that's helping contractors like {{company}} complete 10x more inspections per day while improving accuracy.

**What OrPaynter Does:**
- Analyzes roof damage in 60 seconds using phone photos
- Generates professional, white-label reports
- Provides accurate cost estimates with real-time pricing
- Integrates with your existing workflow

**Real Results from Contractors:**
"Increased our inspection capacity by 300%. Game-changing technology." - Mike R., Dallas contractor
"Generated an extra $50K in revenue this quarter thanks to faster turnarounds." - Sarah L., Austin contractor

**Perfect for {{company}} Because:**

I hope this email finds you well. I'm Oliver Paynter, founder of OrPaynter, and I'm reaching out because I believe we can help {company} dramatically improve claims processing efficiency while reducing fraud.

The Challenge:
Insurance companies lose $7B annually to roofing fraud, while legitimate claims take 45+ days to process, frustrating both customers and adjusters.

Our Solution:
OrPaynter's AI platform processes roofing claims in under 60 seconds with:
- 97% damage detection accuracy
- 94% fraud detection rate  
- 50% reduction in processing time
- $2M+ annual savings for mid-size insurers

Proof Points:
- Currently piloting with State Farm (45 claims processed)
- 250+ beta users with 4.8/5 satisfaction
- $2.3M in damage accurately detected and documented

Next Step:
I'd love to show you a 15-minute demo of how we're revolutionizing claims processing. Are you available for a brief call next week?

Best regards,
Oliver Paynter

As a fellow roofing professional (I've been in the business for 15+ years), I know how time-consuming manual roof inspections can be.

That's why I built OrPaynter - AI technology that's helping contractors like {company} complete 10x more inspections per day while improving accuracy.

What OrPaynter Does:
- Analyzes roof damage in 60 seconds using phone photos
- Generates professional, white-label reports
- Provides accurate cost estimates with real-time pricing
- Integrates with your existing workflow

Real Results:
"Increased our inspection capacity by 300%. Game-changing technology." - Mike R., Dallas contractor

Want to See It in Action?
I'd love to show you a live demo and discuss how OrPaynter can help {company} win more jobs and increase efficiency.
