## 4. Database Schema Design

A high-level database schema is proposed below, based on the data models in the technical specifications. The schema is designed to be normalized and scalable, with clear relationships between entities.

### 4.1. PostgreSQL (Relational Data)

**`users` Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    phone_number VARCHAR(255),
    first_name VARCHAR(255),
    last_name VARCHAR(255),
    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    company_id UUID,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    last_login TIMESTAMPTZ,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    profile_complete BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
```

**`projects` Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE projects (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    homeowner_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    property_id UUID REFERENCES properties(id),
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),

    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    due_date DATE,
    total_amount NUMERIC(10, 2),
    amount_paid NUMERIC(10, 2),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 4.2. MongoDB (Document Data)

**`contractor_profiles` Collection:**
```json

  "description": "text",
  "years_in_business": "integer",
  "license_number": "string",
  "insurance_info": {
    "liability_coverage": "decimal",
    "expiration_date": "date"
  },
  "portfolio": ["url"],
  "reviews": [
    {
      "user_id": "uuid",
      "rating": "integer",
      "comment": "text",
      "created_at": "timestamp"
    }
  ]
}
```


## 5. API Endpoint Specifications

| `/api/v1/payments`                   | POST   | Process a payment for an invoice.              |


## 6. AI/ML Component Requirements

The AI/ML components are central to the OrPaynter platform's value proposition. The following outlines the requirements and implementation approach for these components.

### 6.1. Damage Detection Model

*   **Objective:** To accurately detect and classify various types of roof damage from images.
*   **Input:** High-resolution images of roofs (from drones or manual inspections).
*   **Output:** A JSON object detailing the type, location, and severity of detected damage.
*   **Model:** A deep learning-based computer vision model, likely a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) such as a custom-trained YOLO or a model built on a pre-trained base like ResNet or EfficientNet.
*   **Training Data:** A large, diverse, and accurately labeled dataset of roof images is critical. This dataset must be continuously expanded and refined.

### 6.2. Cost Estimation Algorithm

*   **Objective:** To generate accurate and transparent cost estimates for roof repairs or replacements.
*   **Input:** The output from the damage detection model, property location (for regional cost variations), and real-time material and labor costs.
*   **Output:** A detailed line-item estimate, including materials, labor, and other costs.
*   **Algorithm:** A combination of a rule-based system (for standard repairs) and a machine learning model (for more complex scenarios). The model could be a regression model trained on historical project data.


## 7. Development Timeline and Milestones

The development timeline is divided into four main phases, as outlined in the `implementation_roadmap.md`. The following is a high-level summary with key milestones:

*   **Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3):**
    *   **Milestone:** MVP launch with core features: user registration, project creation, AI damage detection (beta), and basic marketplace.
*   **Phase 2: Transaction Expansion (Months 4-6):**
    *   **Milestone:** Full-featured marketplace with insurance claim processing and lead generation.
*   **Phase 3: API Development (Months 7-9):**
    *   **Milestone:** Public API launch with developer portal and API monetization features.
*   **Phase 4: Advanced Features & White-Label Solutions (Months 10-12):**
    *   **Milestone:** Launch of advanced AI features (3D/VR) and white-label solutions for enterprise clients.


## 8. Architecture: MVP vs. Full Platform

*   **MVP Architecture:** The MVP will be built on the same microservices architecture as the full platform, but with a smaller set of services. The focus will be on the core services required for the initial launch.
*   **Full Platform Architecture:** The full platform will include all the microservices outlined in the `technical_specifications.md`, with a more robust and scalable infrastructure to handle a larger user base and more complex features.
