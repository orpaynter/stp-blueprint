# Research Plan: OrPaynter AI Platform Technical Analysis

## Objectives
- To conduct a thorough analysis of the provided technical specifications, implementation roadmap, and business model for the OrPaynter AI Platform.
- To produce a comprehensive development specification and technical implementation plan that is ready for a development team to execute.

## Research Breakdown
- **Phase 1: Information Gathering and Analysis**
  - Sub-task 1.1: Read and comprehend the `technical_specifications.md`.
  - Sub-task 1.2: Read and comprehend the `implementation_roadmap.md`.
  - Sub-task 1.3: Read and comprehend the `business_model.md`.
  - Sub-task 1.4: Synthesize the information from all three documents to create a unified understanding of the project requirements.

- **Phase 2: MVP Definition and Feature Prioritization**
  - Sub-task 2.1: Identify all features mentioned in the documentation.
  - Sub-task 2.2: Prioritize features for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) based on the business model and implementation roadmap.
  - Sub-task 2.3: Categorize features by priority (e.g., P0, P1, P2) and complexity (High, Medium, Low).

- **Phase 3: Technical Specification and Design**
  - Sub-task 3.1: Recommend a technology stack (frontend, backend, database, AI/ML components) with clear justifications.
  - Sub-task 3.2: Design a preliminary database schema based on the data models in the technical specifications.
  - Sub-task 3.3: Define the specifications for the core API endpoints.
  - Sub-task 3.4: Outline the requirements and a high-level implementation approach for the AI/ML components.

- **Phase 4: Implementation Planning**
  - Sub-task 4.1: Develop a detailed, realistic development timeline with key milestones, building upon the provided roadmap.
  - Sub-task 4.2: Identify potential technical challenges, risks, and mitigation strategies.
  - Sub-task 4.3: Define the architecture for both the MVP and the full platform, highlighting the differences and evolution path.

- **Phase 5: Deliverable Creation**
  - Sub-task 5.1: Consolidate all findings into a single, comprehensive report.
  - Sub-task 5.2: Structure the report logically with sections for each of the required analysis points.
  - Sub-task 5.3: Ensure the final document is well-written, clear, and provides actionable guidance for a development team.

## Key Questions
1. What are the absolute essential features for the MVP to be viable?
2. What are the most significant technical challenges and how can they be addressed?
3. What is the most appropriate technology stack that balances performance, scalability, and development speed?
4. How can the database be designed to accommodate the complex relationships between users, projects, and financial data?
5. What are the specific inputs and outputs for the core AI/ML models (e.g., damage detection, cost estimation)?
6. How can the 9-month roadmap be broken down into more granular development sprints or phases?

## Resource Strategy
- Primary data sources: `technical_specifications.md`, `implementation_roadmap.md`, `business_model.md`
- Search strategies: N/A - all information is provided in the workspace.

## Verification Plan
- Source requirements: The analysis will be based solely on the provided documents.
- Cross-validation: Information from each document will be cross-referenced with the others to ensure consistency and a holistic understanding. For instance, business priorities from `business_model.md` will inform feature prioritization, and the `implementation_roadmap.md` will guide the timeline.

## Expected Deliverables
- A single markdown file named `OrPaynter_AI_Platform_Development_Plan.md` containing the complete technical analysis and implementation plan.

## Workflow Selection
- Primary focus: Search (within the provided files) and Synthesis.
- Justification: The task requires deep analysis and synthesis of existing documentation rather than external verification of facts. The primary effort will be in understanding, structuring, and planning based on the provided materials.
