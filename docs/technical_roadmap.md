2.  **Implement AI Model Integration:**
    *   Replace mock `DamageDetectionModel` with the actual trained model.
    *   Replace mock `CostEstimationModel` with the actual trained model.
    *   Implement the `FraudDetector` model and integrate it with the `Claims Processing` API.
    *   Implement the `Scheduler` model and integrate it with the `Scheduling` API.
3.  **Develop Real-time UI Integration:**
    *   Implement a WebSocket or server-sent event (SSE) service to push real-time updates to the frontend.
    *   Integrate the frontend with the real-time service to display live progress of AI analysis.
4.  **Implement Robust Authentication & Authorization:**
    *   Replace the `X-User-ID` header with a JWT-based authentication system.
    *   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain endpoints based on user roles (Homeowner, Contractor, Insurance).
5.  **Create API Gateway Configuration:**
    *   Configure an API gateway (e.g., Amazon API Gateway, Traefik) to route requests to the appropriate microservices.
    *   Implement rate limiting, logging, and monitoring at the gateway level.
6.  **Develop Regression Testing Suite:**
    *   Create a suite of automated regression tests for each AI endpoint.
    *   Integrate the tests into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality.

### Resource Requirements:

*   2 Backend Engineers
*   1 Frontend Engineer
*   1 DevOps Engineer

*   **Risk:** Inaccurate AI model predictions.
    *   **Mitigation:** Continuously monitor model performance and retrain models as needed. Implement a human-in-the-loop system for reviewing and correcting low-confidence predictions.
*   **Risk:** Security vulnerabilities in the API.
    *   **Mitigation:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing. Implement input validation, output encoding, and other security best practices.

## 2. Platform Deployment & CI/CD

### Priority: High
### Timeline: 4 Weeks

### Action Items:

1.  **Design Cloud Infrastructure on AWS:**
    *   Use Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) to deploy and manage the Docker-containerized microservices.
    *   Utilize an Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic to the microservices.
    *   Store Docker images in Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry).
    *   Use Amazon RDS for the PostgreSQL database, Amazon DocumentDB for MongoDB, and Amazon ElastiCache for Redis.
    *   Use Amazon S3 for storing uploaded files and other static assets.
2.  **Create Staging and Production Environments:**
    *   Create separate VPCs (Virtual Private Clouds) for the staging and production environments to ensure isolation.
    *   Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) to define and manage the cloud infrastructure.
3.  **Implement CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions:**
    *   Create a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds and tests the microservices on every push to the `main` branch.
    *   The workflow should then push the Docker images to ECR and deploy the updated services to the staging environment.
    *   Implement a manual approval step for deploying to the production environment.
4.  **Implement Monitoring, Logging, and Health Checks:**
    *   Use Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring metrics and logs from the microservices and other AWS services.
    *   Create CloudWatch Alarms to be notified of any issues.
    *   Implement detailed health checks for each microservice that go beyond a simple `200 OK` response.
5.  **Plan Backup and Rollback Strategies:**
    *   Configure automated backups for the databases and other critical data.
    *   Implement a blue/green deployment strategy to allow for easy rollbacks in case of a failed deployment.

### Resource Requirements:

*   2 DevOps Engineers
*   1 Backend Engineer
*   AWS Account with appropriate permissions

### Success Criteria:

*   Staging and production environments are fully provisioned and operational on AWS.
*   CI/CD pipeline automatically deploys changes to the staging environment.
*   Production deployments are manually triggered and use a blue/green deployment strategy.
*   Comprehensive monitoring and logging are in place.
*   Backup and rollback procedures are tested and documented.

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation:

*   **Risk:** Budget overruns due to inefficient use of cloud resources.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement cost monitoring and alerts. Use auto-scaling and other cost-optimization features of AWS.
*   **Risk:** Downtime due to failed deployments.
    *   **Mitigation:** Use a blue/green deployment strategy to allow for easy rollbacks. Implement automated testing in the CI/CD pipeline to catch issues before they reach production.
