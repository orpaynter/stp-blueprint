## Overview

The OrPaynter AI Platform leverages DSPy-based self-optimizing agents to provide intelligent automation for the roofing industry. These agents combine large language models (LLMs) with domain-specific logic to deliver accurate, reliable results for damage assessment, cost estimation, scheduling, and fraud detection.
