# Security Policy

## OrPaynter AI Platform Security Overview

### 1. Authentication & Access Control
- User registration and authentication use JWT tokens.
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) with TOTP is implemented, including setup, enable, disable, and verification endpoints.
- Role-based permissions are enforced.

### 2. Secure Credential & Session Management
- Passwords are hashed using Bcrypt before storage.
- JWT and refresh tokens are securely managed (HTTP-only cookies, token blacklisting).
- Redis is used for session and token management.

### 3. API and Input Security
- Input validation and sanitization on all endpoints.
- Rate limiting via Redis prevents abuse.
- File uploads are scanned for viruses and restricted by type.

### 4. Database & Data Security
- SQL injection prevention is enforced in backend services.
- Sensitive fields (passwords, MFA secrets) are never exposed in API responses.

### 5. Infrastructure and Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption is required for sensitive data transfers.
- Regular security audits and compliance with data protection regulations are planned.
- Secure credential management for all secrets and keys.

### 6. Logging & Monitoring
- Audit logging for platform activities is enabled.

### 7. Additional Security Practices
- Containerization (Docker) and AWS ECS/Fargate for secure deployment.
- CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions with security in mind.
